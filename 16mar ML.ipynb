    "In machine learning, overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too well, including the noise and random fluctuations in the data. This results in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data. The consequence of overfitting is that the model may have poor generalization ability and may not perform well on new data.\n",
