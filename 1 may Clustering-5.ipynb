    "Limitation: A model may achieve high accuracy by learning patterns that are not relevant to the underlying task (overfitting).\n",

    "Multiclass Imbalance:\n",

    "Limitation: In multiclass classification, accuracy might not adequately capture the performance, especially if there are imbalances across multiple classes.\n",

    "Uncertainty and Confidence:\n",
    "\n",
    "Limitation: Accuracy does not account for the model's confidence or uncertainty in its predictions.\n",
    "Addressing: Explore metrics like calibration curves or use uncertainty estimates from probabilistic models. Additionally, consider metrics like log-loss, which penalizes misclassifications based on confidence.\n",
    "Class Hierarchies:\n",
