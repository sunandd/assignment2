    "In Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or a template for creating objects. It defines a set of attributes (data members) and methods (functions) that the objects instantiated from the class will have. An object, on the other hand, is an instance of a class â€“ it is a concrete realization of the class, with specific values assigned to its attributes."

    "The four pillars of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Encapsulation: This involves bundling the data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, known as a class. Encapsulation helps in hiding the internal details of an object and protecting its state from external interference. It also allows for the implementation of access control to restrict the visibility of certain aspects of the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction: Abstraction is the process of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors relevant to the problem at hand. It involves defining the essential features of an object while ignoring the non-essential details. Abstraction helps in managing complexity and focusing on relevant aspects of the objects in a program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance: Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class (subclass or derived class) to inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class). This promotes code reusability and establishes a relationship between the classes. The subclass can also extend or override the functionality of the superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects and allows a single function or method to work with objects of various types. Polymorphism can be achieved through method overloading (multiple methods with the same name but different parameters) and method overriding (providing a specific implementation for a method in a subclass).\n",
    "\n",
    "These four pillars provide a foundation for building well-organized, modular, and reusable code in object-oriented programming.\n",

    "Method Invocation:\n",
    "\n",

    "Instance Creation:\n",
