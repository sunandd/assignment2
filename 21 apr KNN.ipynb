    "1. Computational Complexity:\n",
    "Drawback: KNN can be computationally expensive, especially as the size of the dataset and the number of dimensions increase.\n",
    "Mitigation:\n",
    "Use optimized data structures like kd-trees or ball trees to speed up the search for nearest neighbors.\n",
    "Consider dimensionality reduction techniques if dealing with high-dimensional data.\n",
    "2. Sensitivity to Outliers:\n",

    "Implement robust preprocessing steps, such as outlier detection and removal.\n",
    "Consider using distance-weighted voting to give less weight to outliers.\n",

    "Mitigation:\n",
    "Consider local weighting schemes or use algorithms that adapt to varying densities in the data, such as kernel density estimation.\n",
    "6. Memory Usage:\n",
