    "HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is the foundation of data communication on the World Wide Web. It defines a set of methods, also known as HTTP verbs, to indicate the desired action to be performed on the identified resource. Two commonly used HTTP methods are GET and POST.\n",

    "Purpose: The GET method is used to request data from a specified resource.\n",
    "Data in URL: Parameters are included in the URL, typically after a \"?\" symbol.\n",
    "Visibility: Data is visible to everyone (e.g., in the browser's address bar).\n",
