    "\n",
    "1-Design the application as a collection of services: Cloud applications are best deployed as a collection of cloud services, or APIs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Decouple the data: If you tightly couple the data to the application, it won’t find a good home in the cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Consider communications between application components.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Model and design for performance and scaling.\n",

    "1-Infrastructure: Traditional web hosting uses a single server or a group of servers located in a single location to host websites, while cloud hosting uses a network of servers in different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "2-Scalability: Cloud hosting offers greater scalability and flexibility than traditional hosting, which provides fewer features at a lower price point.\n",
    "\n",
    "3-Data control: With traditional web hosting, you have to share the server with other users, so you have less control over it.\n",
    "\n",
    "4-Cost: Cloud hosting can be more expensive than traditional hosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "5-Security: Both cloud hosting and traditional hosting can be secure, but cloud hosting is generally considered more secure."
