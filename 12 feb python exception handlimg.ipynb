    "What is an Exception in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, an exception is an event or error that occurs during the execution of a program and disrupts the normal flow of the program's instructions. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by appropriate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Differences between Exceptions and Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax Errors:\n",
    "\n",
    "Syntax errors are errors that occur when the Python interpreter encounters incorrect syntax in your code.\n",
    "These errors prevent the program from running and need to be fixed before the program can be executed.\n",
    "Examples of syntax errors include missing parentheses, incorrect indentation, or misspelled keywords.\n",
    "Exceptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "Exceptions, on the other hand, occur during the execution of a program even if the syntax is correct.\n",
    "They represent runtime errors and can be caused by various reasons such as division by zero, attempting to access an index that doesn't exist, or trying to open a non-existent file.\n",
    "Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks, allowing the program to recover gracefully from unexpected situations.\n",
    "In summary, syntax errors are related to the structure of the code and prevent the program from running, while exceptions are runtime errors that occur during program execution and can be handled to prevent the program from crashing."
