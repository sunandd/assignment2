    "Definition: Abstraction involves simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on their essential properties and behaviors, while hiding unnecessary details.\n",

    "Definition: Encapsulation involves bundling the data (attributes) and the methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit called a class. It also includes restricting access to some of an object's components, controlling the level of visibility.\n",
    "Purpose: It helps in achieving data hiding, protecting the internal state of an object from outside interference. Encapsulation allows the object to manage its own state, and changes to the internal representation can be made without affecting the external code that uses the class.\n",
    "Example: Consider a class Person that has private attributes like name and age. Encapsulation ensures that these attributes are not directly accessible from outside the class. Instead, methods like get_name() and set_age() are used to interact with or modify these attributes. This way, the internal representation of a Person object is encapsulated."

    "Polymorphism:\n",
