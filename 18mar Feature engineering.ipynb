    "The Filter method is a feature selection technique that selects features independently of the machine learning algorithm model. It ranks each feature based on some statistical measure and then selects the highest-ranking features. This method uses statistical techniques to evaluate the relationship between each input variable and the target variable, and these scores are used as the basis to choose those input variables that will be used in the model"

    "The primary difference between the Filter method and the Wrapper method for feature selection is that Filter methods measure the relevance of features by their correlation with the dependent variable while Wrapper methods measure the usefulness of a subset of features by actually training a model on it. Filter methods pick up the intrinsic properties of the features measured via univariate statistics instead of cross-validation performance, while Wrapper methods measure the “usefulness” of features based on the classifier performance"
