This allows you to respond to UI and tool events in the browser with computations or queries using the full power of Python, automatically push server-side updates to the UI elements such as widgets or plots in the browser, and use periodic, timeout, and asynchronous callbacks to drive streaming updates.\n",

Some of the capabilities of the Bokeh server include UI widgets and plot selections that drive computations and plot updates, streaming live data to automatically updating plots, and intelligent server-side downsampling of large datasets"
