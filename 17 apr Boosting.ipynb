    "Gradient Boosting Regression is a machine learning technique used for both classification and regression problems. It belongs to the ensemble learning family, where multiple weak learners (usually decision trees) are combined to create a strong predictive model. Gradient Boosting Regression specifically focuses on regression problems, where the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic idea behind gradient boosting is to sequentially train weak learners and combine them to improve the overall predictive performance. Here's a high-level overview of how gradient boosting regression works:\n",
    "\n",
    "Initialization:\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm starts with a simple model, often a single decision tree with a shallow depth, called a weak learner.\n",
    "Sequential Training:\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is trained on the dataset, and the residuals (the differences between predicted and actual values) are computed.\n",
    "A new weak learner is then trained to predict these residuals, rather than the original target values.\n",
    "Combination of Weak Learners:\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions from each weak learner are combined, and the combined model is updated by adjusting the weights of the weak learners based on their performance.\n",
    "This process is repeated for a predefined number of iterations or until a certain level of performance is achieved.\n",
    "Final Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "The final model is an ensemble of weak learners, each contributing to the overall prediction.\n",
    "The term \"gradient\" in gradient boosting refers to the optimization technique used to minimize the loss function. The algorithm minimizes the loss by moving in the direction (gradient) of steepest decrease in the loss function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popular implementations of gradient boosting regression include XGBoost, LightGBM, and AdaBoost with regression trees. These algorithms have become widely used in various machine learning competitions and real-world applications due to their effectiveness in building accurate and robust predictive models."
