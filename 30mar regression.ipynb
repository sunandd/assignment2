    "Elastic Net Regression is a type of linear regression that combines the strengths of both Ridge and Lasso Regression. It regularizes regression models by utilizing the penalties associated with both Ridge and Lasso Regression methods. This makes it particularly useful when dealing with strongly correlated data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Elastic Net Regression differs from other regression techniques in that it uses a combination of L1 and L2 penalties. The L1 penalty, used in Lasso Regression, can set some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively removing them from the model. The L2 penalty, used in Ridge Regression, shrinks all coefficients towards zero but does not set any of them exactly to zero. Elastic Net Regression combines these two penalties to achieve a balance between feature selection and coefficient shrinkage."

    "In Elastic Net Regression, there are two regularization parameters that need to be chosen: alpha and the L1 ratio. Alpha controls the overall strength of the regularization, while the L1 ratio determines the balance between the L1 and L2 penalties.\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal values of these parameters can be chosen using cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to assess how well a model will generalize to new data. It involves dividing the data into several subsets and training the model on some of these subsets while evaluating its performance on the remaining subsets.\n",

    "In the context of Elastic Net Regression, cross-validation can be used to choose the optimal values of alpha and the L1 ratio by evaluating the model’s performance for different values of these parameters and selecting the values that give the best performance. This can be done using a grid search, where a range of values for alpha and the L1 ratio is specified and the model is evaluated for each combination of values in the range.\n",
