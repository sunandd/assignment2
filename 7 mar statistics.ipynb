    "The mean, median, and mode are all measures of central tendency, but they differ in how they represent the central value of a dataset and how they are calculated. Here's their differences and how they are used:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean:\n",
    "Definition: The mean is the sum of all values in a dataset divided by the number of data points. Mathematically, it can be represented as (Σx) / n, where Σx is the sum of all values and n is the number of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: Add up all the values and divide by the total count of data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers) because it takes into account the magnitude of each data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mean is commonly used when the dataset is roughly symmetric and doesn't have significant outliers. It provides a balanced representation of the dataset's central value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median:\n",
    "Definition: The median is the middle value in a dataset when the data points are arranged in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of data points, the median is calculated as the average of the two middle values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: Arrange the data in order and find the middle value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The median is less sensitive to extreme values than the mean because it only considers the position of data points, not their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The median is preferred when dealing with datasets that have outliers or are skewed because it is a robust measure that doesn't get heavily influenced by extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode:\n",
    "Definition: The mode is the value that appears most frequently in a dataset. A dataset may have one mode (unimodal), two modes (bimodal), or more (multimodal).\n",
    "\n",
    "Calculation: Identify the value that occurs most often in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sensitivity to Outliers: The mode is not affected by extreme values since it only focuses on frequency.\n",
    "\n",
    "Use: The mode is useful when dealing with categorical data or discrete variables. It helps identify the most common category or value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, the mean represents the average value, the median represents the middle value, and the mode represents the most frequent value in a dataset. They each have their strengths and weaknesses in measuring central tendency, and the choice of which one to use depends on the characteristics of the data set."

    "- Definition: The range is the simplest measure of dispersion. It is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset.\n",

    "2. Median:\n",
    "As mentioned above, in a normal distribution, the median is equal to the mean. This occurs because the data points are symmetrically distributed around the center (mean), and half of the data falls on either side of the mean.\n",

    "3. Mode:\n",
    "For a normal distribution, the mode is also equal to the mean and median. Since the distribution is symmetric, the peak or highest point of the curve (where the mode is located) coincides with the center of the distribution (mean and median).\n",

    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (variance and standard deviation).

    "Outliers can significantly impact measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode) and measures of dispersion (variance and standard deviation). An outlier is a data point that is significantly different from the other data points in the dataset, often lying far away from the rest of the values. Let's see how outliers affect these measures:\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Central Tendency:\n",
    "Mean: Outliers can heavily influence the mean because the mean takes into account the value of each data point. A single extreme outlier can shift the mean significantly, pulling it towards the extreme value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: The median is less affected by outliers since it only considers the position of the data points. As a result, the median provides a more robust measure of central tendency in the presence of outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mode: The mode is not affected by outliers at all since it simply represents the most frequently occurring value in the dataset, regardless of any extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Measures of Dispersion:\n",
    "Variance and Standard Deviation: Outliers can increase the variance and standard deviation because these measures incorporate the squared differences between data points and the mean. Since outliers can be significantly distant from the mean, squaring these deviations can lead to a significant increase in variance and, consequently, the standard deviation.\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider the following dataset representing the test scores of 10 students:\n",
    "[85, 88, 92, 86, 90, 91, 94, 87, 100, 45]\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's calculate the mean, median, variance, and standard deviation for this dataset:\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean: (85 + 88 + 92 + 86 + 90 + 91 + 94 + 87 + 100 + 45) / 10 = 858 / 10 = 85.8\n",
    "\n",
    "Median: Since there are 10 data points, the median is the average of the 5th and 6th values, which are 90 and 91. Median = (90 + 91) / 2 = 181 / 2 = 90.5\n",
    "\n",
    "Variance:\n",
    "Variance = [(85 - 85.8)² + (88 - 85.8)² + ... + (100 - 85.8)² + (45 - 85.8)²] / 10 ≈ 213.96\n",
    "\n",
    "Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation ≈ √213.96 ≈ 14.62\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's add an outlier to the dataset:\n",
    "[85, 88, 92, 86, 90, 91, 94, 87, 100, 45, 200]\n",
    "\n",
    "New Mean: (858 + 200) / 11 ≈ 99.81\n",
    "New Median: Since there are 11 data points, the median is the 6th value, which is 91.\n",
    "New Variance: Variance ≈ 1992.8\n",
    "New Standard Deviation: Standard Deviation ≈ √1992.8 ≈ 44.64\n",
    "\n",
    "As we can see, the presence of the outlier significantly affected the mean, variance, and standard deviation, but it had little impact on the median. This demonstrates how outliers can distort the measures of central tendency and dispersion, especially the mean and standard deviation, making them less representative of the typical data characteristics.\n"
